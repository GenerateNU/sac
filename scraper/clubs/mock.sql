Purpose Statement: To raise awareness and knowledge about MSF&rsquo;s work in the field and global health crises by fundraising MSF&rsquo;s work, encouraging students to get involved in their community, and raising awareness of medical humanitarian issues via advocacy campaigns and informational resource creation.
Description:
As an affiliated student chapter of the Doctors Without Borders non-profit organization, we aim to raise awareness and knowledge about MSF&rsquo;s work in the field and global health crises by fundraising MSF&rsquo;s work, encouraging students to get involved in their community, and raising awareness of medical humanitarian issues via advocacy campaigns and informational resource creation. We will accomplish our goals by actively fundraising for the Doctors Without Borders organization, engaging in volunteer efforts at NEU and within the local community, hosting prominent guest speakers from NEU, Doctors Without Borders, and other organizations, and more. In addition, the Friends Of MSF chapter at NEU will help students of any major find a path by which they may aid in humanitarian efforts around the world.
MSF Student Chapters aim to:

Raise awareness and knowledge about MSF&rsquo;s work in the field and about humanitarian issues
Encourage students to consider working with non-governmental organizations, such as MSF, post-graduation
Support MSF in advocacy campaigns
Raise money for MSF, their work in the field, and specific campaigns

What do we do?

Spread awareness of MSF&rsquo;s activities and mission 
Provide educational and community service opportunities
Foster engagement of Northeastern students in the health of our local community
Conduct research to develop advocacy campaigns for polarizing medical humanitarian issues that students at Northeastern may not be aware of 
Provide professional development opportunities for students to help them acquire meaningful community service opportunities, develop the career-essential skills they need to succeed in both interviews and a professional setting such as a co-op, and learn more about a variety of healthcare disciplines and how they may fit onto that path even if they are not necessarily on the pre-health track

Whether you want to sharpen your technical interview skills, compete among hundreds of collegiate teams worldwide, or simply just chill and make friends while you solve Leetcode-style problems, HCPC welcomes coders of all skill levels!
 
The gist of competitive programming is basically solving problems fast. "Fast" is both in the sense of algorithmic efficiency (big O) and in the sense of problem solving speed. That may sounds daunting but don''t worry. We aim to provide an iterative learning process via informative workshops and practical contests to teach you the skills and techniques needed to succeed.
 
If competitions are your jam, we send several teams each year to compete in  ICPC - the International Collegiate Programming Contest, where competitions are held at a qualifying, regional, divisional, national, and international level. Each contest consists of teams of 3 working together to solve a set of challenging problems in a set amount of time. Overall, it''s an intense time but a fantastic experience. If you''re looking for more competitions, websites such as CodeForces, USACO, and Hackerrank provide contests that we may occasionally take an interest in as well.
 
If you aren''t interested in competitions, that''s fine too! The skills you learn through our contests and workshops is not only applicable to competitions, but also technical interviews and coding challenges. We invite you to come to our internal contests where you can make friends and brainstorm with others to solve challenging problems. In addition, our workshops aim to provide knowledge on various CP topics such as prefix sums, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.
 

So come through to HCPC! We meet every week on Mondays 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM Eastern Time. Every meeting will be held in East Village 002. Hope to see yall there!

Overall, we aim to build a safe community here.', 'Vision: ISIB hopes to be a resource in a club form that offers to primarily assist international students integrate in the US workforce and become global business leaders.
One major setback that international students face when coming to study in the US, is the uncertainty of having viable job prospects in the US after graduation due to the Visa/Work Permit issue. Currently, US college graduates without a STEM major get 12 months of OPT and STEM students a total of 29 months. After this period, students must hope that companies will sponsor them for an H-1B visa, which very few companies do and these companies are also difficult to find.
Additionally, the club also hopes to offer guidance to international student on how to be successful as internationals in the professional world, and how they should be able to utilize their skills to their advantage.
 
Strategy: We hope to have our club consist of two components. The first component would be to have a research division to the club. The researchers would have the responsibility of researching &amp; contacting companies for positions that offer sponsorship or offer to hire international students. In the long run we would hopefully be able to build relationships with these companies where we can hopefully send an international student every year to work there. The findings of our research will be available to all our members and we would also encourage members to have a genuine crowdsourcing mentality, where if they find a position that does not require sponsorship, that they share it with the rest of the group members.
Alternatively, we would also like to bring in guest speakers, in a group discussion setting, to give members the opportunity to talk and discuss on how to be successful international professionals. Researchers and Eboard members in our club would also be responsible for reach out to potential guest speakers.
 
Objectives: The three objectives we have are Place &amp; Educate &amp; Serve. We want to place as much of our international members into secure jobs after graduation. We want to educate the international student body on how they are able to be global leaders by bringing in proven professionals in an array of fields to offer advice and guidance. Lastly, it is also important to serve. This is done by researchers in the club and general members sharing jobs that they have found that do not require sponsorships to all other members of the club. We would highly encourage researchers to be non-international students that want to ensure that their peers have as many opportunity possibilities as possible after graduation.

From fun and lighthearted games to deeper, candid conversations, we hope to experience the full depths of life and live out the reality of a loving God.
We are a dynamic group of students who want to:
1. Be a diverse community growing together in love, faith, and knowledge of Jesus Christ.
2. See the power of Christ transform the lives of students at Northeastern holistically, spiritually, emotionally, intellectually.
3. Promote dialogue and be a safe and open place for all wanting to grow deeper in the knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ and his teachings, regardless of one''s spiritual background.
4. Promote the biblical basis for ethnic and racial reconciliation.
5. Engage in issues surrounding poverty through local and global outreach and service opportunities.

Since 2018, Peace Through Play has been partnered with the Northeastern University Human Services Program and our faculty advisor Dr. Emily Mann, a senior research associate and teaching professor with the program. Dr. Mann''s "Science of Play" honors seminar students collaborate with our executive board each year to develop supplemental materials for our curriculum that promote the power of play with respect to child development.
As most people may guess, play is a critical part of child development. It allows children to problem solve; cultivate their imaginations; discover their interests and improve their language, motor, and executive function skills. Peace Through Play also works to emphasize the five core social emotional learning competencies as defined by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL). These competencies lay the foundation for each child''s success academically, socially, and otherwise. For a variety of reasons, ranging from public school budget cuts to an increasing emphasis on academic scores, play is one of the first aspects of the school day to be minimized or eliminated. Peace Through Play provides Boston youth with opportunities to reincorporate that play into their lives and development.

Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service. The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as &ldquo;a part of&rdquo; the general community rather than &ldquo;apart from&rdquo; the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence&hellip;without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the &ldquo;inclusive we&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;exclusive we&rdquo;. From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;Culture For Service and Service For Humanity&rdquo;. Today, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. No longer a single entity, members of the Fraternity have been instrumental in the establishment of the Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club Foundation.

Despite the sustained efforts of leading researchers around the world, no current cure or treatment exists for Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease or any other forms of dementia. Thus, our best bet to decrease the burden of neurodegeneration and its other effects on mental health in our senior population is by capitalizing on preventative mechanisms, such as environmental enrichment. Students to Seniors will accomplish these goals by bringing mentally stimulating activities and social interaction to various populations of the elderly at least once a month. In order to ensure that the organization, above all, does no harm, there will be a mandatory training session for all volunteers before their first volunteer outing. The training sessions will occur in place of a general body meeting, and will include a presentation and discussion on geriatric health. Students to Seniors will furthermore keep in mind the pervasive presence of health inequities, and it will be an interrelated focus of Students to Seniors to ensure that served and underserved populations are addressed equally and with great care.

They participate in challenges, both mental and physical, experience tribal councils, and test their abilities in social psychology, all while making life-long friends.

Our seasons are filmed by a camera crew and uploaded to YouTube after several hours of editing and story-boarding. We look to recruit students who have a competitive nature and demonstrate enthusiasm. Students of all ages, majors, and backgrounds are encouraged to apply and submit a video describing their interest in the show. Those who are not cast are encouraged to participate in our club via production or outside events, like viewing events for the CBS Survivor, outings with the organization, and attending challenges or tribal councils.
The game starts in tribes, where students compete for tribal immunity. The losing tribe must vote out a member of their tribe. When the game has reached about the halfway point, the tribes merge. The contestants then compete for individual immunity and continue to vote each other out. The voted out contestants after the merge become members of the jury, and ultimately vote on the season&rsquo;s winner when there are two or three contestants left. Not only do we live out the game, but we foster friendships and a communal space centered around a common love for the show.
